# planets-sound-game
This is a game/sound synthesis project I am doing for DXARTS 463 at the University of Washington

I am using godot to simulate keplerian orbits.
Data about the planetary bodies is then sent to the sound synthesis part of my project (writted in supercollider).
This data is used to control what sound is generated.
