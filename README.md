# planets-sound-game
I am doing a sound synthesis project using supercollider and godot. This project is in a very incomplete state.

I am using godot to simulate keplerian orbits.
Data about the planetary bodies is then sent to the sound synthesis part of my project (writted in supercollider).
This data is used to control what sound is generated.
I plan to incorporate a midi controller to control spawning of planetary bodies and to control some parameters of my synths.
